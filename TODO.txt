  Add https://github.com/junegunn/fzf and https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim by default?
    Or make some plugins optional via settings in something like `.local.plugins-enabled`?

For `.vimrc.light`:
  See if loading `Sideways` 'on' `gS`/`gJ` helps startup times.
  Consider adding a command / adding a config that causes loading of less used stuff.
  Chart out the useful commands in the imported plugins in a single README.

For `.vimrc`:
  Mark all places different from `.vimrc.light` (besides using NeoBundle).
  Evaluate if they still make sense.
  Consider moving everything extra into two `.plugins` and `.after` files
    that can be imported in `.local.vimrc.*`.
