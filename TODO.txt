Bugs:
  Figure out which plugin breaks `vi(i(`/`va(a(`

Tasks:
  Study and evaluate the differences between the current and the old `.vimrc`.
  Chart out the useful commands in the imported plugins in a single README.

Ideas:
  Make some plugins optional via settings in something like `.local.plugins-enabled`?
